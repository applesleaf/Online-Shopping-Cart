The provided code simulates an online shopping experience through a Python program. It starts by defining a class called ItemToPurchase, which serves as a blueprint for items that users can add to their virtual shopping cart. This class encapsulates essential attributes of an item such as its name, price, and quantity. Additionally, it includes a method called print_item_cost() to calculate and display the total cost of each item.

Moving on to the main function main(), it acts as the central hub for the program's execution. Here, users are prompted to input details for two items they wish to purchase. For each item, the program creates an instance of the ItemToPurchase class and collects information such as the item's name, price, and quantity from the user via the input() function.

Once all the necessary information is gathered, the program calculates the total cost for each item by multiplying its price with its quantity. Subsequently, it computes the grand total by summing up the costs of both items. Finally, the program presents a structured summary of the items chosen by the user, displaying their names, quantities, prices per item, and total costs. Alongside this itemized breakdown, it also showcases the overall total amount to be paid for all selected items.
